This game is called IT Village.

Every Friday night, a group of super-cool programmers gather to play their favorite board game, IT Village. They are so tired of coding during the week that they constantly forget the rules of the program. It is also very difficult for them to work with paper and roll dice and make a very important decision - the game must be developed and turned into a computer game. It is a well-known fact that programmers are lazy people. They started programming the new game, but stopped.

You have a 4x4 game board. The game develops only on the first and last column and the first and last row of the board. All other fields are empty and you cannot play on them.

You start the game from the entry position or from one of the playing fields and roll the dice. The moves are clockwise.

When starting the game, the user draws the starting position and the number of moves. The user sees the results of the games played by him and other users. The users are sorted by the number of games they win.

You start the game with 50 coins. For every motel you buy, you win 20 coins. If you miss a move due to a storm - you do not receive coins if the move is a Wi-Fi motel. The money from Wi-Fi motel is added to your account before your next move.

The game ends when you are out of money, out of moves, buy all motels or step on a VSC field.
